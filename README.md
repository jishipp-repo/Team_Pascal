We will be using the ChestX-ray8 dataset which contains 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients. 
-Each image in the data set contains multiple text-mined labels identifying 14 different pathological conditions. 
-We will use this data to develop a single model that will provide binary classification predictions for each of the 14 labeled pathologies. 
-In other words it will predict 'positive' or 'negative' for each of the pathologies.
